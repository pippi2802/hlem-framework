# High-Level-Event-Mining: A Framework (ICPM 2022)

## Installation

We prefer to run the project on an individual env, so for that we suggest to first do the following:

To create your environment on the project directory:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the env:
```
.\path-to-venv\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

Then when the venv is activated, run the commands below to install the requirements and run the code.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To execute:
```bash
python main.py 
```
